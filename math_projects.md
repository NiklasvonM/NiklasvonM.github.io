## Math Projects

**Project description:** Fun and/or interesting projects during my mathematics studies.

### Fitting an Elephant

> With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.

Fitting curves with increasing deegrees of freedom using Fourier Descriptors. In this case I fit an elephant, but yes, this works for arbitrary curves!

The [fundamental theorem of curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_curves) says that a curve is basically completely determined by it's curvature. The following "artwork" has been constructed using a randomly generated curvature.
