## Math Projects

In the following, I am showing some fun and/or interesting projects I have developed during or inspired by my mathematics studies.

### Fitting an Elephant

Fitting curves with increasing deegrees of freedom using Fourier Descriptors. In this case I fit an elephant, but yes, this works for arbitrary curves!

### Kalman-Bucy Filter

### Frequency Analysis

### Playing with Mathematical Curves

The [fundamental theorem of curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_curves) says that a curve is basically completely determined by it's curvature. The following "artwork" has been constructed using a randomly generated curvature.
