## Personal Dashboard

**Project description:** I've been tracking my mood, activities and location using [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) and the Google Maps Timeline for a couple of years and visualized and analyzed this data. For this purpose, I have developed a R Shiny app of which I am sharing a small excerpt with partially anonymized data.

### Activity Correlation

Simulation of a physical network of activities where correlation corresponds to bond strength and color corresponds to correlation to mood:
