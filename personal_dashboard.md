## Personal Dashboard

**Project description:** I've been tracking my mood, activities and location using <a href="https://daylio.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daylio</a> and the Google Maps Timeline for a couple of years and visualized and analyzed this data. For this purpose, I have developed a R Shiny app of which I am sharing a small excerpt with partially anonymized data.
